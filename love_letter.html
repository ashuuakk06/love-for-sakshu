<h1>To My Sweetheart — Sakshu 💌</h1>

<p>
My love, my jaan, my sunshine — I’m truly sorry 💗  
You mean more to me than anything in this world.<br><br>

When I think of you, my heart becomes warm.  
When I hear your voice, my soul smiles.  
You are not just someone… you are my someone. ❤️<br><br>

I want to hold your hand, look into your eyes,  
and say I love you more every day.  
Please forgive me — your Ashuuu is incomplete without you 💋
